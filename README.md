# PixelPlacer
PixelPlacer is a program created by FTC team 16597 Fulminata so that other teams can visually strategize with team members and other alliance teams. This program allows the user to place pixels on an image of the CenterStage backdrop and change the color of the pixels. It also allows the user to save .png images of the backdrop to use for future reference if desired.
### Placing Pixels

Click on a space where you want to place a pixel. 

Click once to change the pixel to green, twice to change the pixel to purple, and three times to change it to yellow. Four clicks removes the pixel from the board.

### Screenshots

Press the ENTER key on the keyboard to take a screenshot of the board.

Screenshots are saved to your desktop in a folder named PixelPicker. Each file will be saved with a name 0screenShot.png, 1screenShot.png, 2screenShot.png, etc.
